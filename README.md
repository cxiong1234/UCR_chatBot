## Description
In recent years, Large Language Models (LLM) have been broad to the attention of the public and they have demonstrated amazing performance on Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks like question-answering and translation. In our work, we build up a chat bot based on LLM to help the students in UC Riverside. They don't need to search online about their program information rather they can just directly talk to the Chatbot.we utilized 'Flan-Alpaca-Large' model by Declare-Lab. Our chatBot was trained by [2022-2023 UCR general catalog](https://studentdocs.ucr.edu/registrar/UCR_Catalog_2022-23.pdf?_gl=1*1wbj547*_ga*MTU4NDI3MTk2Mi4xNjY2Nzk1NjQ1*_ga_Z1RGSBHBF7*MTY4NTkxODc3NC40Ny4xLjE2ODU5MTkxNTAuMC4wLjA.*_ga_S8BZQKWST2*MTY4NTkxODc3My40Ny4xLjE2ODU5MTkxNTAuMC4wLjA.).
